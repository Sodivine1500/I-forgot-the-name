**MALWARE ANALYSIS WITH FLAREVM**

I created this virtual lab to get a better understanding on how Malware moves, spreads, and works.

The Lab is isolated from my comptuer so it wouldn't spread out my computer, this is thr safest way to do this.

So I first download VMware for virtualization, then I downloaded FlareVm on my computer for all of the cyber forenics tools.
